##Mastermind
Object oriented programming with Ruby  
An exercise from [the Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/oop)

Master is a game where you have to guess you opponent's secret code within a certain number of turns; it is like hangman with colored pegs. Each turn, you get some feedback about how good your guess was -- whether it was exactly correct or that you just guessed the correct color in the wrong space.
